# Find_Waldo

My very first java game!!! This is a simple Find Waldo game, in which the player
has to find Waldo among other characters within the game. Clicking On Waldo will advance the player
to the next level. There are 19 levels total.

Concepts:
The game is mainly based on using MouseEvents, and uses a LinkedList to store all the characters. 
Arrays are used to store the images from the sprite sheets.

Finally Finished!!
